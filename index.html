            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>
                Every machine on a network has a unique identifier. Just as you would address a letter to send in the mail, computers use the unique identifier to send data to specific computers on a network. In the TCP/IP protocol, the unique identifier for a computer is called its IP address.

            <h3>What does an IP address look like?</h3>
            <p>
                The currently used IP addresses (IPv4) look like four blocks of digits ranging from 0 to 255 separated by a period like "132.161.1.655".  An IP address serves 2 functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.  It is assigned to each device that is participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocols for communication purposes.
