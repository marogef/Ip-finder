            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>
                Every machine on a network has a unique identifier. Just as you would address a letter to send in the mail, computers use the unique identifier to send data to specific computers on a network. In the TCP/IP protocol, the unique identifier for a computer is called its IP address.

            <h3>How does it look like?</h3>
            <p>
                The currently used IP addresses (IPv4) look like four blocks of digits ranging from 0 to 255 separated by a period like "132.161.1.655".In the new schema (IPv6) addresses can be written in different ways: 2001:2353:0000:0000:0000:0000:1428:57ab.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>IP addresses are useful</li>
                <li>We will see more development with IP addresses</li>
            </ol>
